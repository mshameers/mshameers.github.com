**How well can we describe charity? How is charity related to poor? How is charity related to God? Finally is charity related to money...?:)**

Well put aside the first question, we will come to this later, i dont know it clearly..!

Most of the charity \'works\' i see around, revolves around the life of \'poor\', the victims of many so called charity organisations i beleive. I am not a good writer, so to the point, 

Let\'s take some from our real life. Out of these, which is charity? 

__Does helping a 90year old man to pass urine, come under charity? or giving money to a sweeper\'s son\'s education, charity? Does serving meal for 100 needy come under charity or funding a bulding project for the \'poor\' to live come under charity?Does buying some things from them for money,come under charity or washing the cloths of a visually challenged, charity.__

If most of the votes will go for saying all are charity, How is it so?  In our minds, including mine, charity is bonded with money to some extend. Because it is the easiest and all of us, those reading this has, it, atleast to serve a \'poor\'s\' one meal. I tend to do what/which is easy for me and argues, it is not that easy..:). Coming back to the question, some of the arguments are 

1. if we help a child to learn, education will make him a better person and he will serve more. So its cumulative and brave ones will choose educating a child as charity rather than wetting our hands for a needy\'s basic needs or buying/giving/serving meal for 100 70+ poors. 

2. Where are the 90+ peoples who needs help? we cant see them often. 

3. Giving meal or helping manually are one time processes, but funding for a project, which targets large number of people is the better option. 

4. For the religious, prayers from many is better than the prayer from one.!

5. whatever we do for the differently abled, comes under charity.

May some of the different opinion might be due to the way, we look/ our mind percepts things, this propotional to the situations we had grown up, i beleive. Charities should not make someone inferior. Giving money, can easily makes a person think, he is bigger than the other person. In the above questions, the former ones has a better chance of making us think unnaturaly, while the later ones really really satisfies our minds.

To the arguments,

1. Even in our own life, if we think upon the things, we got for free or without/ with little effort, we value less. A sweeper's child is not less than me, in thinking, learning, or feeling. She will get oppurtunity, if she got a job as sweeper[for her hardwork]. Also from the past, best comes from the adversity.

2. visit any government hospital in India.

3. ***saving for the past losing the pesent***. Just remember, necessity and needs comes first than comfort.

4. God doesn't need anything from us. I pray for me and others, not for the God. Whoever helps a dying dog to drink water from a tap, evenif she is whore, she will be rewarded.

5. This is difficult. But i will say, evenif one is disabled, dont make him below us. care them along us, without underestimating them. Accepting them withus is also charity.

The needy persons wont come unless they understands, their is no one near them, who really cares. 

***Important***: Dont stop giving money to the \'poor\', since it is the shortcut to reach charity..:)
